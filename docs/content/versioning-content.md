You can create a site in GitBook containing documentation for several product versions. This is especially useful if you want to maintain documentation for different versions of a product or if you need to provide documentation for customers using different versions.

To create documentation for multiple product versions in GitBook, you can create a separate publication for each version. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new publication for each product version you want to support. For example, you can create a publication for version 1.0, another publication for version 2.0, and so on.

2. In each publication, create your content for that particular version of the product. You can use GitBook's versioning feature to keep track of changes and updates for each version.

3. Once you've created your content, you can add links to switch between the different versions of your product documentation. You can use GitBook's navigation menu to create links to each version's publication or use GitBook's versioning feature to create a dropdown menu that allows users to switch between different versions.

With these steps, you can create a site in GitBook containing documentation for several product versions, and provide your users with access to documentation for the specific version they are using.
